# BatteryCurves
Discharge/Charge Curves for batteries and other test data that i have gathered

Currently all discharge curves are measured with my calibrated re:load pro and my [c# data logger program I wrote ages ago](https://github.com/Ralim/Battery-Capacity-Tester).

Each battery folder should have a description in the folder (raise an issue if it does not).
